# Industrial_Management_Project

In this course project on industrial management, we were given the responsibility of establishing a manufacturing/production unit
of that company as a part of its expansion strategy inside India. Assuming we had adequate availability of finances, technology and
equipment, we had to suggest which location in India will be appropriate with proper reasoning.

We chose “Nestle India Limited”, the Indian subsidiary of Swiss based Nestle,
world’s largest food and beverage company. In food manufacturing it comes under the
FMCG sector or the fast moving - consumer goods sector. It is headquartered in
Gurgaon, Haryana with four branch offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.
